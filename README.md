# UnluauNET
A decompiler for Roblox's Lua based programming language (Luau https://luau-lang.org/). The Unluau project consists of three different .NET namespaces: ``Unluau`` (the main decompiler), ``Unluau.CLI`` the command line interface for the decompiler, and ``Unluau.App`` the windows dissasember. This project is still under heavy development, so expect many changes.
