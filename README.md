# Unluau
A decompiler for Roblox's Lua based programming language (Luau https://luau-lang.org/). The Unluau project consists of two different .NET namespaces: ``Unluau`` (the main decompiler) and ``Unluau.CLI`` the command line interface for the decompiler. As of right now, Unluau is the most powerful Luau decompiler availible to the public, supporting most of Luau's opcodes and language features. With Unluau you can take a compiled Luau script and restore it to an accurate representation of what the original script may have been.

Unluau is still in early alpha and is receiving updates frequently. You can download and run any of the alpha versions in the [releases](https://github.com/societall/UnluauNET/releases) tab.

## Usage
As of right now the only availible way to use Unluau is via the CLI (command line interface). If you are interested in learning how to use it or just want to poke around, feel free to check out its deticated section in the documentation [here](docs/cli.md).
